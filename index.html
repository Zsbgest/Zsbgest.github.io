<h1>Hi there, Welcome to Shaobin Zhao's site!</h1>
		    
<p align="justify">
	I'm currently doing an exchange program in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In my home university, the University of Melbourne, I take Engineering Systems under Bachelor of Environments as my major as well as Diploma in Informatics. I pursue careers combining engineering and technologies with architecture, and I'll continue honour degree studies specializing in civil engineering and architecture in the University of New South Wales from July, 2018.
