<h1>Hi there, Welcome to Shaobin Snowbin Zhao's site!</h1>
		    
<p align="justify">
	I'm currently studying civil engineering and architecture at the University of New South Walse, Sydney. Before I moved to Sydney, I completed Bachelor of Environments (Engineering Systems) and Diploma in Informatics at the University of Melbourne, Melbourne. I pursue careers combining engineering and technologies with architecture. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, cooking, volunteering, travelling and hiking. As a nature lover, I'm a big fan of outdoor activities. This personal website was first established in 2017 when I took an exchange study at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, America. From 2019, it has been maintained in stages. All views expressed herein are personal.
